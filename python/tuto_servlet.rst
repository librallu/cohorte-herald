About Servlets

Introduction
============

In this tutorial, we are going to implement a simple REST application
with Herald HTTP servlets.

This application can display a random number.

Some example URLs:

- http:localhost:4000/random/ <- generates a random number between 0 and 100
- http:localhost:4000/random/50 <- generates a random number between 50 and 100
- http:localhost:4000/random/50/75 <- generates a random number between 50 and 75


The core generator
==================

In this part, we will implement the functional kernel of random number generation.
